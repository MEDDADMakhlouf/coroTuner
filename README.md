# Voice Morpher - Real-time Audio Effects Engine üéôÔ∏è

An interactive Android application built with modern Kotlin that processes audio from the microphone in real-time. This project serves as a practical demonstration of digital signal processing (DSP), advanced concurrency with Kotlin Coroutines, and modern UI development with Jetpack Compose.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Audio Pipeline:** Low-latency audio processing from microphone to speaker using `AudioRecord` and `AudioTrack`.
* **Live Effects:** All effects are applied on-the-fly to the live audio stream.
* **Volume/Gain Control:** Amplify or reduce the volume of the input signal.
* **Dynamic Echo Effect:** A powerful echo with real-time controls for both **Delay** (time between echoes) and **Decay** (how quickly the echo fades).
* **Acoustic Echo Cancellation:** Utilizes Android's built-in `AcousticEchoCanceler` to minimize microphone feedback.
* **Modern, Reactive UI:** A clean, single-screen interface built entirely with Jetpack Compose.
